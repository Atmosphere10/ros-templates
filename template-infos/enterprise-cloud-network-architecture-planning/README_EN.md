## Overview of the Solution

For enterprises to move from IDC to the cloud, the overall network design needs to be carried out in the early stage. A cloud-based network architecture based on business logic needs to be built to lay the foundation for moving to the cloud. As the scale and business of enterprises grow, it is necessary to optimize the existing network architecture to ensure the security, stability, and sustainability of business development. Enterprise users often face the following scenarios:

* Implement flexible internal network interconnection, isolation, and traffic diversion strategies according to business logic to plan the layout of network resources.
* Internal network mutual access traffic goes through a firewall for security audit to improve business security.
* The network architecture has high scalability and sustainability.

### Solution Architecture

The default settings provided by the solution will build the website running environment on Alibaba Cloud after deployment as shown in the architecture diagram. When deploying, you can modify some settings according to resource planning, but the final running environment will be similar to the architecture diagram.

The technical architecture of this solution includes the following infrastructure and cloud services:

* 4 Virtual Private Networks (VPCs): Build a trusted private network.
* 9 Switches: Used to mount ECS instances.
* 4 Cloud Server ECS instances: 3 are used to simulate business mutual visits, and 1 is used to simulate a firewall.
* 1 Cloud Enterprise Network instance: Used to manage the entire cloud private network.
* 1 Forwarding Router instance: Used to connect VPCs.

Among them, the interconnection between VPC-PRD1 and VPC-PRD2 needs to go through the simulated firewall audit in VPC-SEC, and VPC-PRD3 is an independent business that is not allowed to interconnect with other VPCs. This solution does not involve code parts simulating firewall audits, and only involves network building.

## Solution Deployment
### Deployment Preparation


Before starting the deployment, please complete the following steps according to the instructions to apply for an account, top up your account, create and authorize RAM users.

#### Account Preparation

1. If you do not have an Alibaba Cloud account, please visit the [Alibaba Cloud Account Registration Page](https://account.aliyun.com/register/qr_register.htm) and follow the prompts to complete registration. An Alibaba Cloud account is the entity that uses cloud resources and is therefore a prerequisite for deploying the solution.
2. [Top up your Alibaba Cloud account](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/324650.html).

   * The cloud resources in this solution support pay-as-you-go, and all default settings use pay-as-you-go guided operations. If you determine that any cloud resource uses pay-as-you-go mode for deployment, the account balance must be greater than or equal to 100 yuan.
   * Completing the deployment and experience of this solution will not exceed 2 yuan.
     
     Assuming that you choose the lowest specification resources available, and the resource runtime does not exceed 1 hour. In actual practice, some instances may not be purchased, so you need to adjust the resource specifications according to the actual situation, and due to the difference in the actual traffic used during your operation process, the cost may vary. Please refer to the actual quotation displayed in the console and the final bill.
     
     The table below is for reference only, and the actual costs may vary.

3. Create a RAM user for the solution deployment.
   
   1. Create 1 RAM user. For details, see [Create a RAM User](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/ram/user-guide/create-a-ram-user).
   2. Grant the following cloud services access permissions to complete the solution deployment. For details, see [Grant Permissions to the RAM User](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/ram/user-guide/grant-permissions-to-the-ram-user).
      
      | **Cloud Service** | **Required Permissions**           | **Description**       |
