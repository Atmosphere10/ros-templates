## Overview of the Solution

The continuous and stable service of business determines the quality of customer service provided by enterprises, which is the foundation for enterprise development. The high availability architecture and elasticity capability of application deployment play a crucial role in the stability and development of business, but enterprises also need to consider the cost of resource maintenance and expense costs. This solution adopts the Serverless architecture on cloud, natively supports elastic scaling, pay-as-you-go, and service hosting, reducing the workload of manual resource management and performance cost optimization for enterprises, while avoiding single point failure risks through high availability configuration.

## Solution Architecture

This architecture adopts a single region with two availability zones deployment, deploying business systems and databases in two different availability zones, achieving availability zone-level fault disaster recovery capabilities, thus ensuring the continuity of business. Services and databases both adopt Alibaba Cloud Serverless products that use on-demand payment to generate lower costs, while supporting elastic scaling to better adapt to business growth. This architecture also uses proprietary network VPC, switches, and security groups across availability zones to achieve system communication under private networks.

The default settings provided by the solution complete the deployment of the Serverless high availability architecture on Alibaba Cloud as shown in the architecture diagram after deployment. In actual deployment, you can modify some settings according to resource planning, but the final operating environment will be similar to the architecture diagram. ![image](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/5119189171/p816264.png)

The technical architecture of this solution includes the following infrastructure and cloud services:

* 1 proprietary network VPC: builds a cloud-based private network for application load balancer ALB, Serverless application engine, and PolarDB MySQL version Serverless cluster cloud resources.
* 5 switches Vswitch: designs a classic architecture with 3 subnet planes (public plane, business plane, data plane), deployed in two availability zones, providing basic network segmentation and isolation functions. ALB spans two availability zones deployed in the public plane, two Serverless application engine instances are deployed in the business plane of two availability zones, and a pair of PolarDB MySQL version Serverless master-slave clusters are deployed in the data plane of two availability zones.
* 1 public application load balancer ALB: distributes public access traffic to different Serverless application engine instances. Public ALB provides public service capabilities through EIP.
* 2 Serverless application engine instances: used to deploy business systems and provide application services.
* 1 PolarDB MySQL version Serverless cluster: provides data services for business systems.

3. Open the [Serverless Application Engine SAE console](https://saenext.console.aliyun.com/overview), and complete the opening operation according to the interface guidance.

### One-click Deployment


One-click deployment is realized based on Alibaba Cloud Resource Orchestration Service ROS (Resource Orchestration Service). The ROS template has defined scripts, which can automatically create and configure cloud resources, improving the creation and deployment efficiency of resources.

#### Operation Steps

You can automatically complete the creation and configuration of these resources through the ROS one-click deployment link provided below:

* Create 2 Serverless application engine instances.
* Create 1 proprietary network VPC.
* Create 5 switches.
* Create 1 PolarDB MySQL version Serverless cluster.

1. Deploy resources one-click.
   
   1. Click [One-click Deployment](https://ros.console.aliyun.com/cn-hangzhou/stacks/create?templateUrl=https://ros-public-templates.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/service_template/technical-solution/serverless-high-availability-architecture.yml&hideStepRow=true&hideStackConfig=true&pageTitle=卓越效能,极简运维,Serverless高可用架构 &disableRollback=false&isSimplified=true&disableNavigation=true&productNavBar=disabled&balanceIntercept=true), select the region at the top navigation bar.
   2. Modify **Resource Stack Name** in the configuration page, and select and configure parameters as needed.
   3. When the **Resource Stack Information** page's **Status** displays **Create Success**, the one-click configuration is completed.
### Completion and Cleanup


#### Solution Verification

**One, verify the service availability by accessing the ALB DNS name**

1. Log in to the [Application Load Balancer ALB console](https://slb.console.aliyun.com/alb), and obtain the DNS name of the ALB instance from the instance list.
2. Access the DNS name through the browser to check if the sample application can be accessed normally. ![image](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/4347407171/p803472.png)

**Two, configure elastic scaling and perform load testing through Apache Benchmark to verify the elasticity and high availability of the Serverless architecture**

##### Configure Elastic Scaling

1. Open the [Serverless Application Engine SAE console](https://saenext.console.aliyun.com/overview), click the left navigation bar to select **Application Management > Application List**. Click the current application name to enter the application details page.
2. In the **Elastic Scaling** tab, add an elastic policy, and configure according to the picture.
   
   ![image](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/9428313371/p879276.png)
3. After adding, click Enable in the **Elastic Scaling** tab under the **Monitoring Metrics Policy List**. For more configuration methods, refer to [Configure an Auto Scaling Policy](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/sae/serverless-app-engine-classic/user-guide/configure-an-auto-scaling-policy).

##### Perform Load Testing

1. Install the test tool Apache Benchmark. Mac OS systems have installed this test tool by default. Installation tutorials for other operating systems can be found in the [official documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/install.html). ![image](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/7033829171/p814072.png)
2. Use the Apache Benchmark command to perform load testing in the local terminal, simulating different concurrent requests and durations. Obtain the DNS name of the ALB instance from the [Application Load Balancer ALB console](https://slb.console.aliyun.com/alb) instance details, and replace `<ALB instance's DNS name>` with the actual value.
   
   ```
   ab -n 20000 -c 200 http://<ALB instance's DNS name>/
   ```
   
   | **Command** | **Description** |
   | --- | --- |
   | ab | Apache Benchmark provided pressure testing tool command. |
   | -c | The number of requests created at once. |
   | -n | The number of requests executed in one test session. |

##### Verify Elastic Scaling Capability

1. After the command execution, click **Application Events**, and under the **All Source Types** drop-down list, select **HorizontalPodAutoscaler**, and you can see the elastic scaling reason. ![image](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/5360078271/p857616.png)
2. In the **Basic Information** page, click **Instance Deployment Information**, and you can see the change in the number of instances, with the running instances increasing from 2 to 6.
   
   ![image](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/9428313371/p881361.png)

The above operations verify the elastic scaling capability of the Serverless architecture. The system can adjust resources automatically according to the load to ensure the efficient operation of the business. In addition, the current scheme adopts a single region with two availability zones deployment, where the business system and database are deployed in different availability zones, ensuring the high availability of the system. Even if one availability zone fails, the resources in another availability zone can continue to provide services, ensuring the continuity and stability of the business.
