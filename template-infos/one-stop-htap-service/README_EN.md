## Overview

When facing the demand of online statistical analysis of large-scale business data, traditional databases often fail to meet the requirements of high performance and real-time analysis. With the continuous growth of the ClickHouse community, more and more developers are hoping to accelerate analysis by synchronizing MySQL data to ClickHouse. Although ClickHouse officially launched the MaterializedMySQL method, how to synchronize MySQL data in a simple, convenient, fast and flexible way to ClickHouse is a rather complicated problem, which requires a lot of black screen operations to configure synchronization.

This solution integrates MySQL and ClickHouse through productization, realizing user visualization and white screen operation data one-click synchronization, flexibly configuring the real-time synchronization of MySQL and ClickHouse table data, building an easy-to-use and better one-stop HTAP (Hybrid Transaction/Analytical Processing) solution. By utilizing ClickHouse's online real-time analysis capability, it solves the online statistical analysis of large-scale business data, such as business report statistics, interactive operational analysis, reconciliation and real-time data warehouse, achieving transaction online processing and online analysis integration.

### Architecture

The default settings provided by the scheme (such as region, VPC, security group, vSwitch, instance name, etc.) complete the deployment of RDS MySQL real-time data synchronization to Cloud Database ClickHouse for accelerated analysis on Alibaba Cloud. When deploying in practice, you can modify some settings according to resource planning, but the final operating environment and architecture diagram are similar.


The technical architecture of this scheme includes the following infrastructure and cloud services:

* Region and Availability Zone: The RDS MySQL instance and the Cloud Database ClickHouse instance must be in the same region, and can be deployed in different availability zones.
* 1 Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): The RDS MySQL instance and the Cloud Database ClickHouse instance must be in the same VPC network environment.
* 1 RDS MySQL instance: The RDS MySQL instance is used for daily online business (OLTP) system database access operations, etc.
* 1 Cloud Database ClickHouse instance: The Cloud Database ClickHouse instance is used to synchronize RDS MySQL instance data to the Cloud Database ClickHouse, achieving accelerated access to MySQL data, used for real-time reports, operational analysis, etc. OLAP business.
## Deployment
### Preparation


Before deployment, please follow the instructions below to complete account application, service activation, network planning, resource planning, etc. preparation work.

#### Account Preparation

1. If you do not have an Alibaba Cloud account, please visit the [Alibaba Cloud account registration page](https://account.aliyun.com/register/qr_register.htm) and follow the prompts to register. The Alibaba Cloud account is the entity that uses cloud resources, so it is a necessary prerequisite for deployment schemes.
2. [Top up your Alibaba Cloud account](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/324650.html).

   1. To save costs, this scheme defaults to using pay-as-you-go resources. Using pay-as-you-go resources requires ensuring that the account balance is not less than 100 yuan.
   2. Completing the deployment and experience of this scheme is expected to cost no more than 20 yuan (assuming you choose the relevant specification resources in the following table, and the running time does not exceed 2 hours. If you adjust the resource specifications, please refer to the actual quotation and final bill displayed in the console).
      
      | **Cloud Service** | **Specification Configuration** | **Region** | **Estimated Cost Reference** |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | Cloud Database RDS MySQL Edition | Specification: mysql.x4.xlarge.2c (8 cores 32GB) Storage Space: 100 GB (ESSD PL1) | East China 2 (Shanghai) | 6.10 yuan/hour |
      | Cloud Database ClickHouse Edition | Specification: Single Copy Edition Standard Type 8 Cores 32GB Storage Space: 100 GB (ESSD PL1) | East China 2 (Shanghai) | 2.981 yuan/hour |
      | Cloud Server ECS | Specification: ecs.t6-c2m1.large Storage Space: 40 GB (ESSD PL1) | East China 2 (Shanghai) | Configuration Fee: 0.143 yuan/hour Public Network Traffic Fee: 0.800 yuan/GB |
      | Pay-as-you-go fee: 9.224 yuan/hour Public Network Traffic Fee: 0.800 yuan/GB | | | |
3. The Alibaba Cloud account has the highest level of permissions for operating resources. From the perspective of cloud resource security, it is recommended that you create a RAM user. The RAM user needs to obtain the access permission of the relevant cloud service to complete the scheme deployment. Details are as follows:
   
   | **Cloud Service** | **Required Permission** | **Description** |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Resource Orchestration ROS | * AliyunROSFullAccess * AliyunOOSFullAccess | Manage ROS service permissions |
   | Virtual Private Cloud VPC | AliyunVPCFullAccess | Manage VPC service permissions |
   | Cloud Database RDS MySQL Edition | AliyunRDSFullAccess | Manage RDS service permissions |
   | Cloud Database ClickHouse Edition | AliyunClickHouseFullAccess | Manage ClickHouse service permissions |
