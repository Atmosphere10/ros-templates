## Overview of the Solution

This solution introduces the detailed process of deploying [Stable-Diffusion-WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) using model online service PAI-EAS and performing AI painting in WebUI. After completing the deployment and experience of this solution, the expected cost will not exceed 15 yuan. (Assuming that you choose the lowest specification PAI-EAS resource, and the resource runs for no more than 40 minutes. If you adjust the resource specifications, please refer to the actual quotation displayed on the console and the final bill.) Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image generation model based on latent diffusion models. It is a free open-source project that can generate corresponding pictures according to text descriptions with many advantages such as low latency and good generation effect. Stable-Diffusion-WebUI is packaged on its basis, providing a more simple and easy-to-operate UI. **This solution is based on model online service PAI-EAS to realize convenient cloud deployment of Stable-Diffusion-WebUI (hereinafter referred to as SD WebUI), and use it for AI painting.**

Alibaba Cloud ensures compatibility with the open source version as a premise, and develops and releases the PAI SD WebUI solution based on cloud-based form and enterprise user needs. The specific advantages and functions are as follows:

* Convenient use: Quick deployment, ready-to-use; GPU and other underlying resources can be dynamically switched according to needs.
* Enterprise-level features: Front-end and back-end separation transformation, support for multi-user cluster scheduling for multiple GPUs; user isolation support; bill splitting support.
* Plugins and optimization: Support PAI-Blade performance optimization tools; provide FileBrowser plugin, allowing users to upload and download cloud models, images from desktop; provide self-developed ModelZoo plugin, supporting open source model download acceleration.

### Solution Architecture

In actual deployment, you can complete the deployment according to the default settings provided by this solution. After deployment, the running architecture is as follows:

![image](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/3732017071/p762308.png)

The technical architecture of this solution includes the following infrastructure and cloud services:

* Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Form a private network on the cloud.
* Switch: Provides basic network segmentation and isolation functions.
* Public Network NAT Gateway: Used to forward requests from private network resources to the public network, enabling private network resources to provide services externally.
* Elastic Public IP: Combined with NAT gateway, helps users achieve outbound traffic forwarding, inbound address conversion, and public access functions, and more flexible management and use of public resources.
* Security Group: Used to restrict the flow of network input and output under VPC switches.
* Storage system: It is recommended to use file storage NAS. Large capacity, high cost-effectiveness, elastic expansion, suitable for general-purpose file sharing business, used to store various results generated by SD WebUI.
* Model Online Service PAI-EAS instance: Used to deploy SD WebUI.

Compared with one-click deployment, you can also manually deploy to customize some settings, thereby better meeting your actual needs. For details, see [Manually Deploy Stable Diffusion WebUI Service](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/pai/use-cases/manually-deploy-the-stable-diffusion-webui-service).

## Solution Deployment
### Deployment Resources


Resource orchestration ROS can describe the required cloud resources and their dependencies through YAML or JSON files, and then automatically create and configure these resources. You can automatically complete the creation and configuration of the following resources through the ROS one-click deployment link provided below:

* Create 1 VPC
* Create 1 switch
* Create 1 security group
* Create 1 elastic public IP
* Create 1 public NAT gateway
* Create 1 NAS file system
* Deploy 1 PAI-EAS service

1. Click [One-click Deployment](https://ros.console.aliyun.com/ap-southeast-1/stacks/create?spm=a2c4g.2509703.0.0.30393abas2QwOs&templateUrl=https://ros-public-templates.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/service_template/technical-solution/pai-ai-painting-solution.yml&hideStepRow=true&pageTitle=PAI%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2%E5%A4%9A%E5%BD%A2%E6%80%81%E7%9A%84Stable%20Diffusion%20WebUI%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1&isSimplified=true&disableNavigation=true&productNavBar=disabled), go to the **PAI Deployment of Multi-form Stable Diffusion WebUI Service** ROS one-click deployment page.
2. Confirm the **region**, **availability zone ID**, and **rollback when failure** parameters, and then click **Create**. After about 10 minutes, the model deployment will be completed.
   
   The region of this solution is **Singapore**. **Since after opening the elastic public IP service in the Singapore region, Civitai and Github have efficient and stable access speeds, you can directly download plugins and Civitai models through WebUI, and the WebUI webpage operation experience is consistent with that in China. Therefore, it is recommended to choose Singapore.**
3. When the **resource stack information** page shows the **status** as **create success**, the one-click configuration is completed.
### Solution Verification


After completing the above operations, you have successfully completed the deployment of the SD WebUI cluster version. You can start the WebUI page to verify the model inference.

1. Enter the **Model Online Service (EAS)** page.
   
   1. Log in to the [PAI console](https://pai.console.aliyun.com/?regionId=ap-southeast-1#/workspace/overview).
   2. In the top menu bar, select **Singapore** region.
   3. In the left navigation bar, click **Workspace List**, and then in the workspace list page, click any workspace name to enter the corresponding workspace. If there is no available workspace, create a workspace.
   4. In the workspace page, in the left navigation bar, select **Model Deployment** > **Model Online Service (EAS)**, and enter the **Model Online Service (EAS)** page.
2. In the **Model Online Service (EAS)** page, click the **View Web Application** column of the deployed model service in the **service mode** column.
   
   The first time you log in, you need to wait about 5 minutes in your dedicated workspace home page, and then click **Enter Stable Diffusion WebUI** to enter the WebUI page.
3. In the SD WebUI page **Text-to-Image** tab, enter the positive prompt word Prompt, such as `a monkey is eating a green banana`, and then click **Generate**, and the AI painting will be completed. The effect is shown as follows: ![image](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/4732017071/p762417.png)
   
   Subsequently, you can complete tasks such as text-to-image, image-to-image through SD WebUI, and you can also use SD WebUI to perform post-processing, model fusion and training, etc. In addition, you can also use FileBrowser for file management. FileBrowser supports uploading and downloading cloud models and pictures from desktop.
### Resource Cleanup


In this solution, you deployed 1 PAI-EAS service, created 1 virtual private cloud VPC, 1 switch, 1 public NAT gateway, 1 elastic public IP, 1 security group and 1 file storage NAS. After testing the solution, you can handle the corresponding product instances according to the following rules to avoid continuing to incur costs:

1. Log in to the [ROS console](https://ros.console.aliyun.com/overview).
2. In the left navigation bar, select **Resource Stack**.
3. At the top, select the region where the deployed resource stack is located (in this case, Singapore), and then click the **Operation** column of the specified resource stack.
4. In the **Delete Resource Stack** dialog box, select **Release Resources** for deletion method, and then click **OK** to complete resource release according to the prompt.
