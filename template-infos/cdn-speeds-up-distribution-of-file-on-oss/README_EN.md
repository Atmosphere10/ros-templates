## Overview of the Solution

When operating an e-commerce website, the website will generate a large amount of product detail data (such as pictures, videos, etc.). When using Alibaba Cloud OSS products to store static files on the source station, in order to ensure that all users can access the website smoothly, you can use Alibaba Cloud CDN products to distribute the OSS files to improve the website's access performance and reduce traffic costs. The business value and advantages are as follows:

* Users access website resources through CDN to distribute traffic and reduce the pressure on the source station.
* CDN provides low-cost file content distribution services and adopts a tiered pricing method. The more the usage, the lower the unit price of the traffic.
* Users obtain resources from the CDN node closest to the client, reducing network transmission distance and ensuring the quality of static resource transmission.

## Solution Architecture

The static resources of the e-commerce website are stored on OSS. CDN will cache the static resources (picture files, audio files, video files, etc.) of the OSS source station in the global acceleration nodes of CDN. When users request to access or download resources, they can get the cached resources on the CDN node nearby to achieve resource acceleration. The default settings after the deployment of the website running environment is shown in the architecture diagram. In actual deployment, you can modify some settings according to the resource planning, but the final running environment is similar to the architecture diagram.


The technical architecture of this solution includes the following infrastructure and cloud services:

* Object Storage OSS: used to store the product details materials generated by the e-commerce website.
* Content Delivery Network CDN: used to accelerate the static file resources of the e-commerce website.

## Solution Deployment
### Deployment Preparation


Before deploying, please complete the account application, account recharge, RAM user creation and authorization according to the following instructions.

1. If you do not have an Alibaba Cloud account, please visit the [Alibaba Cloud Account Registration Page](https://account.aliyun.com/register/qr_register.htm), follow the prompts on the page to register and complete personal real-name authentication. An Alibaba Cloud account is the entity that pays for the cloud resources, so it is a necessary prerequisite for deploying the solution.
2. [Recharge your Alibaba Cloud account](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/324650.html). To save costs, this solution defaults to using pay-as-you-go. Pay-as-you-go resources require that the account balance is not less than 100 yuan. The estimated cost of deploying and experiencing this solution is about 5 yuan (assuming that you choose to use pay-as-you-go when configuring the CDN product and OSS product, and the traffic generated during the verification process is within 10 GB. The actual situation may vary due to the size of the traffic used in your operation process, so the cost may change. Please refer to the actual quote displayed on the console and the final bill).
3. You already have at least one domain name, and the domain name has been registered. If it is not registered, you can log in to the [AliCloud ICP Proxy Registration Management System](https://beian.aliyun.com/pcContainer/myorder) to complete the registration.
4. The Alibaba Cloud account has the highest permissions to operate resources. From the perspective of cloud resource security, it is recommended that you create a RAM user. RAM users need to obtain the access permissions of related cloud services to complete the solution deployment. Details are as follows:

| **Cloud Service** | **Required Permissions** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Content Delivery Network CDN | AliyunCDNFullAccess | Manage the content delivery network CDN permissions |
| Object Storage OSS | AliyunOSSFullAccess | Manage the cloud server OSS permissions |

Instructions for creating a RAM user and authorizing it are provided in the [Create a RAM User](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/ram/user-guide/create-a-ram-user) and [Grant Permissions to the RAM User](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/ram/user-guide/grant-permissions-to-the-ram-user).
### One-click Deployment


#### ROS One-click Deployment

Resource Orchestration (ROS) allows you to clearly and concisely describe the required cloud resources and their dependencies through YAML or JSON files, and then automatically create and configure these resources. You can automate the creation and configuration of these resources through the ROS one-click deployment link provided below:

* Create 1 OSS Bucket.
* Create 1 CDN accelerated domain name, and set the OSS Bucket created earlier as the source station.

1. Open the [One-click Configuration Template Link](https://ros.console.aliyun.com/region/stacks/create?templateUrl=https://ros-public-templates.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/service_template/technical-solution/cdn-speeds-up-distribution-of-file-on-oss.yml&pageTitle=Files Download Acceleration and Cost Optimization&disableRollback=false&isSimplified=true&productNavBar=disabled) to go to the ROS console. The system automatically opens the panel for creating a new resource stack, and displays the detailed information of the YAML file in the **Template Content** area.
   
   **Note** 
   * By default, the ROS console is in the region where you last accessed the console. Please modify the region according to the region where the resources you create are located before proceeding.
   * This ROS one-click deployment template does not include the configuration of CNAME resolution records for accelerated domain names. If you need to configure CNAME resolution records for accelerated domain names, please refer to the manual deployment steps.
2. After confirming the region, keep all options unchanged on the page, and click **Next** to enter the **Configure Template Parameters** page.
3. In the **Configure Template Parameters** page, modify the resource stack name, accelerate domain name, accelerate region, storage space name, etc. Fill in all required information and confirm it, and then click **Create** to start the one-click configuration.
4. When the **Resource Stack Information** page shows the **Status** as **Created Successfully**, the one-click configuration is completed.
### Verification and Cleanup


#### Scheme Verification

**1. Verify the static resource caching strategy through the URL address of the browser and view the request header**

1. Log in to the [OSS console](https://oss.console.aliyun.com/), and in the navigation bar on the left under the history access path, click the Bucket name created earlier to enter the file list, and click the directory created in the previous step.
![image](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/2770679271/p863042.png)
2. Click the Upload File button, and other configurations remain unchanged. In the **Pending Upload Files**, drag and drop the picture to upload. This example uses \_MG\_0090.jpg.
3. Open the browser and access the CDN resource URL address. Example: http://image.example.com/image_data/\_MG\_0090.jpg
   
   **Note** 
   
   The CDN resource URL address is constructed as: http://the CDN configured domain name/source station created OSS directory name/file name
4. When the browser displays the uploaded picture, open the browser developer tools and find the request header as follows. ![image.png](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/1780713961/p711665.png)You can see that the request header contains Last-Modified and X-swift-cachetime in the cache mechanism, as well as the Via and X-Cache specific fields in CDN, which verifies that the static resource caching strategy is effective.
   
   **Note** 
   
   X-swift-cachetime is a response header, usually used to indicate the cache time or cache-related information;
   
   Last-Modified: This is the head information provided by the server in the response, indicating the last modification time of the resource on the server

**2. Verify the static resource acceleration effect through network dial test by comparing before and after optimization**

1. Visit the [One-time Dial Test Tool](https://cloudmonitor.console.aliyun.com/disposableTest), and set the region to overseas.
2. The first screenshot below is the data before optimization (direct access to the source station), and the second screenshot is the data after optimization (after CDN acceleration). You can see that after CDN acceleration, the data transmission speed is faster and the time is shorter.

#### Resource Cleanup

In this scheme, you upload files and create accelerated domain names in OSS. After testing the scheme, you can delete the resource stack and related resources directly in the ROS console; or you can manually handle the corresponding products' resources to avoid continuing to incur costs according to the following methods:

* Delete the OSS files and Bucket resources in OSS:
  
  1. Log in to the [OSS console](https://oss.console.aliyun.com/), click **Bucket List**, and then click the target Bucket name.
  2. In the navigation bar on the left, select **File Management** > **File List**
