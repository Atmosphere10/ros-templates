## Overview of the Solution

This solution aims to deploy microservices through Alibaba Cloud Container Service Kubernetes Edition (ACK) and realize efficient resource utilization, higher scalability and elasticity, rapid iteration deployment, and DevOps process optimization by leveraging container technology and the powerful features of Kubernetes. This will comprehensively enhance business flexibility and competitiveness. Through this solution, enterprises can achieve containerized transformation of application deployment, improve operation and maintenance efficiency, optimize resource utilization, and accelerate business innovation, laying a solid foundation for enterprise digital upgrades.

## Solution Architecture

This solution introduces how to use ACK to deploy microservice applications, improve operation and maintenance efficiency, optimize resource utilization, accelerate business innovation, and market response speed. When deploying in practice, you can modify some settings according to resource planning, but the final runtime environment and architecture diagram are similar. ![image](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/0993189171/p816170.png)

The simulated application service provides API `a` and API `b` externally. API `a` depends on API `b`. API `b` returns the service name and a UUID; API `a` returns the service name and a UUID as well as the return value of API `b` through HTTP request.

The technical architecture of this solution includes the following infrastructure and cloud services:

* 1 VPC: builds a private cloud network for application load balancing ALB, ECS servers, and ACK clusters
* 2 switches: enables communication between 3 ECS servers, ACK clusters, and ALB in multiple availability zones, and provides basic network segmentation and isolation functions.
* 1 public ALB: provides access externally, serving as the Ingress for ACK cluster.
* 1 ACK cluster
* 3 ECS servers: used to deploy the simulated application service, for ACK use.
## Solution Deployment
### Deployment Preparation


Before deploying, please complete the following steps to apply for an account and top up your account balance according to the instructions.

#### Account Preparation

1. If you do not have an Alibaba Cloud account, please visit the [Alibaba Cloud Account Registration Page](https://account.aliyun.com/register/qr_register.htm) and follow the prompts to register. An Alibaba Cloud account is the entity that uses cloud resources and is therefore a prerequisite for deploying the solution.
2. [Top up your Alibaba Cloud account](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/324650.html). The cloud resources in this solution support pay-as-you-go, and the default settings all guide operations with pay-as-you-go. If you determine that any cloud resource is deployed using pay-as-you-go, the account balance must be greater than or equal to 100 yuan.
### One-Click Deployment


**ROS One-Click Deployment**
-----------

1. Open the [One-Click Configuration Template Link](https://ros.console.aliyun.com/region/stacks/create?templateUrl=https://ros-public-templates.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/service_template/technical-solution/build-microservices-on-ack.yml&hideStepRow=true&hideStackConfig=true&pageTitle=Flexible Scheduling, Efficient Arrangement, Containerized Management of Cloud Applications&disableRollback=false&isSimplified=true&disableNavigation=true&productNavBar=disabled&balanceIntercept=true) to go to the ROS console. The system automatically opens the panel for creating a resource stack using new resources, and displays the detailed information of the YAML file in the **Template Content** area.
   
   **Note** 
   
   The ROS console defaults to the region where you last accessed the console. Please modify the corresponding region according to the region where the new resources are located before proceeding.
2. After confirming the region, the system automatically refreshes the configuration template parameter page.
3. On the **Configuration Template Parameters** page, modify the resource stack name, availability zone, and ECS instance configuration (it is recommended to use **General Computing Type**, **ecs.u1-c1m2.xlarge**). After filling in all required information and confirming, click **Create** to start one-click configuration.
   
   **Note** 
   
   To prevent insufficient availability zone resources from preventing ALB from accessing, it is recommended to select Availability Zones J and K here.
4. When the **Resource Stack Information** page shows the **Status** as **Created Successfully**, the one-click configuration is completed. Note:
   
### Verification and Resource Cleanup


#### Solution Verification

**I. Verify the service availability through ALB Ingress**

After completing the one-click deployment, log in to the ACK console, create the ALB Ingress, and initiate a visit to verify whether the service has been successfully deployed.

1. Log in to the [Container Service ACK Management Console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com/#/k8s/cluster/list).
2. In the left navigation bar, select **Cluster**, click the created cluster, and start operating.
3. In the left navigation bar, select **Network**, expand the menu, and find the ALB Ingress of the created cluster. Obtain the **Endpoint Domain Name** in the **Endpoint** column, and visit the **Endpoint Domain Name/a** in the browser to view the return value, such as:

```
[
    {
        "serviceName": "a",
        "uuid": "f1b99e7a-e731-4a3b-aa22-5e8a3abd577c"
    },
    {
        "serviceName": "b",
        "uuid": "d1eee41e-3259-4eb2-a018-43b7df64589b"
    }
]
```

The simulated application service is running normally.

**II. Verify the scaling up and down of the service through manual and automatic elastic scaling**

1. Manual Elastic Scaling

In the [Container Service ACK Management Console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com/?spm=a2c4g.2808202.0.0.5fb6a985o1vHY7#/k8s/cluster/list), select the target cluster, and in the left navigation bar, select **Node Management > Node Pool**. Click **Go to Configure**.

To quickly see the scaling phenomenon, modify the following parameters.
