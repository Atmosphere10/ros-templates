## Overview

In many business scenarios (such as product information queries, inventory management, account balance queries, transaction record queries, user information queries, etc.), to improve data query speed and reduce database pressure, we usually use Redis as a cache layer. However, maintaining data consistency between MySQL and Redis cache is a key challenge. This solution will explore an efficient MySQL and Redis cache synchronization consistency scheme based on the Cache-Aside Pattern model to ensure the real-time and accuracy of business data, improve data query speed, and reduce database pressure.

**Note**

The advantages of the Cache-Aside Pattern are that it can effectively reduce database pressure and improve application performance and scalability. However, if the data in the cache expires or is not updated, it may cause the application to read old data. In addition, the Cache-Aside Pattern is not suitable for applications with frequent data updates because the cache constantly expires and updates, causing the data in the cache to be unstable.

## Solution Architecture

The default settings provided by the solution (such as region, VPC, security group, vSwitch, instance name, etc.) complete the architecture diagram of RDS MySQL real-time data synchronization to accelerate analysis of cloud database Redis on Alibaba Cloud. When deploying in practice, you can modify some settings according to resource planning, but the final operating environment and architecture diagram are similar.


The technical architecture of this solution includes the following infrastructure and cloud services:

* Region and Availability Zone: The cloud database RDS MySQL instance, cloud database Redis instance, and data transmission service DTS instance must be in the same region, but they can be deployed in different availability zones.
* 1 Virtual Private Network (VPC): The cloud database RDS MySQL instance, cloud database Redis instance, and data transmission service DTS instance must be in the same VPC network environment.
* 1 cloud database RDS MySQL edition instance: Provides data persistence services and transaction consistency services for online orders/ticketing services, etc.
* 1 cloud database Redis edition instance: Provides online order/ticketing services, such as cache acceleration, inventory query, and flash sale throttling, etc.
* 1 data transmission service DTS instance: Subscribes to the BINLOG log data of related database tables in the cloud database RDS MySQL.
* 1 cloud server ECS instance: Deploys the DTS subscription application to receive the update events of the cloud database RDS MySQL subscribed by the data transmission service DTS and update the cloud database Redis through the application.

## Deployment
### Preparation


Before deployment, please follow the instructions below to complete account registration and account recharge.

### Prepare Account

1. If you do not have an Alibaba Cloud account, visit the [Alibaba Cloud account registration page](https://account.aliyun.com/register/qr_register.htm) and follow the prompts to register. The Alibaba Cloud account is the entity used to pay for cloud resources, so it is a prerequisite for deploying the solution.
2. [Recharge your Alibaba Cloud account](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/324650.html).

   1. To save costs, this solution defaults to using Pay-As-You-Go resources. Using Pay-As-You-Go resources requires that your account balance is not less than 100 yuan.
   2. The estimated cost of completing the deployment and experience of this solution is no more than 20 yuan (assuming you choose the relevant specifications of the resources listed in the table below, and the running time does not exceed 2 hours. If you adjust the resource specifications, please refer to the actual quotation and final bill displayed on the console).
      
      | **Cloud Service** | **Specification Configuration** | **Region** | **Estimated Cost Reference** |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | Cloud Server ECS | Specification: ecs.g5.xlarge, 4 vCPU 16 GB Storage Space: 40 GB (ESSD PL1 Cloud Disk) Bandwidth: 100 Mbps (Pay-As-You-Go) | East China 2 (Shanghai) | Configuration Fee: 1.854 yuan/hour Public Network Traffic Fee: 0.800 yuan/GB |
      | Cloud Database RDS MySQL Edition | Specification: mysql.x4.medium.2c Storage Space: 100 GB | East China 2 (Shanghai) | 1.8 yuan/hour |
      | Cloud Database Redis | Specification: Standard Edition High Availability 16GB Master-Slave Edition | East China 2 (Shanghai) | 3.00 yuan/hour |
      | Data Transmission Service DTS | Subscription | East China 2 (Shanghai) | 3.00 yuan/hour |
      | Pay-As-You-Go Cost: 9.654 yuan/hour Public Network Traffic Fee: 0.800 yuan/GB | | | |
      
      **Note**

      During the deployment process, due to the involvement of resource operation permissions, to simplify the operation process, it is recommended to use the main account of Alibaba Cloud for the experience.
