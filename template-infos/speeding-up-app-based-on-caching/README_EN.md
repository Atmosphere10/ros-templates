## Overview of the Solution

This solution aims to build a cache based on cloud database Redis Edition (ApsaraDB for Redis) to speed up applications and improve business system performance, reduce response time, and enable applications to handle higher loads.

## Solution Architecture

The default settings provided by the solution complete the deployment of the operating environment on Alibaba Cloud as shown in the architecture diagram. When deploying, you can modify some settings according to resource planning, but the final operating environment will be similar to the architecture diagram. ![image](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/9537613271/p832288.png)

The solution simulates the scenario of employee and department association, where the HTTP API takes the department ID as a parameter to obtain the employee IDs and names under the department. Data is queried from the database first, and if Redis is used as the cache, the data will still be queried from the database during the initial load. After the data expires, it can still be queried from the cache. After the database data is cleared, the cache will still be available due to its expiration period.

The technical architecture of this solution includes the following infrastructure and cloud services:

* 1 VPC: Forms a private network on Alibaba Cloud for application-type load balancing ALB, cloud servers ECS, cloud databases RDS MySQL Edition, and cloud databases Redis Edition.
* 1 switch: Connects 1 cloud server ECS to the same network, enabling communication between them, and providing basic network segmentation and isolation functions.
* 1 cloud server ECS: Used to deploy simulated services.
* 1 cloud database RDS MySQL Edition instance: Provides data services for simulated services.
* 1 cloud database Redis Edition instance: Provides caching services

## Solution Deployment
### Deployment Preparation


Before starting the deployment, please follow the instructions below to apply for an account, top up your account, create RAM users, and authorize them.

#### Account Preparation

1. If you do not have an Alibaba Cloud account, visit the [Alibaba Cloud Account Registration Page](https://account.aliyun.com/register/qr_register.htm) to complete the registration. The Alibaba Cloud account is the entity that pays for the use of cloud resources, so it is a prerequisite for deploying the solution.
2. [Top up your account balance](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/324650.html). The cloud resources in this solution support pay-as-you-go pricing, and the default settings all guide operations using pay-as-you-go pricing. If any cloud resource is deployed using pay-as-you-go pricing, the account balance must be greater than or equal to 100 yuan.
