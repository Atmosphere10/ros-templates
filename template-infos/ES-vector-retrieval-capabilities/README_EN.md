## Solution Overview

This solution demonstrates how to use the vector retrieval capability of Elasticsearch version of the search analysis service to implement personalized product recommendations. By utilizing the vector retrieval function of Elasticsearch, user behavior data (such as search records, click behaviors, preferences, etc.) and product or content features are quantified for efficient similarity calculation. In this way, personalized recommendations can be quickly generated for users, enhancing user experience and increasing user stickiness. In addition, with the powerful infrastructure of Alibaba Cloud, enterprises can easily scale their recommendation systems to effectively address challenges such as traffic fluctuations and data growth. This solution is not only applicable to e-commerce platforms but also widely applicable to content recommendations, music recommendations, and other scenarios, bringing higher business value to enterprises.

## Solution Architecture

The default settings provided in this solution will build a running environment similar to the architecture diagram once deployed on Alibaba Cloud. When actually deploying, you can adjust some settings according to specific resource planning, but the final running environment will be similar to the architecture shown in the architecture diagram.


The technical architecture of this solution includes the following infrastructure and cloud services:

* 1 Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): The cloud server ECS and the search analysis service Elasticsearch version are created under this VPC.
* 1 Switch: The cloud server ECS and the search analysis service Elasticsearch version are created under this switch.
* 1 Cloud Server ECS: Used to deploy the sample application.
* 1 Search Analysis Service Elasticsearch instance: Indexes product data and is used for personalized recommendations.
## Solution Deployment
### Deployment Preparation

Before starting the deployment, please complete account application, account recharge, service activation, and authorization according to the following instructions.

1. If you do not have an Alibaba Cloud account, please visit the [Alibaba Cloud Account Registration Page](https://account.aliyun.com/register/qr_register.htm) and follow the prompts to register. An Alibaba Cloud account is the entity that pays for your use of cloud resources, so it is a prerequisite for deploying the solution.
2. [Recharge your Alibaba Cloud account](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/324650.html).
   
   1. To save costs, this solution defaults to using all pay-as-you-go resources. Using pay-as-you-go resources requires ensuring that your account balance is not less than 100 yuan.
   2. Completing the deployment and experience of this solution is expected to incur costs of no more than 10 yuan (assuming you choose the example specifications in this article and the resources run for no more than 60 minutes. In actual operation, due to differences in the actual traffic used during your operations, the cost may vary. Please refer to the actual quotation displayed on the console and the final bill, as shown in the table below for reference only).
      
      | **No.** | **Product** | **Specification** | **Region** | **Description** |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | 1 | ECS Cloud Server | * For best practices on selecting ECS instances, see [Instance Type Selection Guidance](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/ecs/user-guide/best-practices-for-instance-type-selection). * This tutorial uses the `ecs.e-c1m2.large` specification as an example. | East China 1 (Hangzhou) | Take the case where the total amount of inflow and outflow within 1 hour does not exceed 1 GB. |
      | 2 | Search Analysis Service Elasticsearch | * This tutorial uses the **enhanced kernel** `7.10` as an example. | East China 1 (Hangzhou) | Take the case where the storage volume and index write volume within 1 hour do not exceed 1 GB. |
### Deploy Resources


Click [One-click Deployment](https://ros.console.aliyun.com/region/stacks/create?templateUrl=https://ros-public-templates.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/service_template/technical-solution/ES-vector-retrieval-capabilities.yml&hideStepRow=true&hideStackConfig=true&pageTitle=使用精准分析检索，打造商品推荐体验&disableRollback=false&isSimplified=true&disableNavigation=true&productNavBar=disabled) to go to the ROS console, select the ECS instance specification and availability zone, enter the ECS instance password, Elasticsearch instance password, and the initial username and password for the sample application. The specific costs incurred will vary depending on the selected ECS specification, and will be based on the console display.
